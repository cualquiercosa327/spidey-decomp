- ghidra-psx-loader has wrong alignment for structs
- gcc operators here: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/1b84dc3709f339801f34093ccece9f484ff2b60e/gcc/cp/operators.def
- jumping is to code further away
- loop condition is the condition before the loop and at the end of the loop block
- composed if statements will change register allocation
- it's really easy to trip up the msvc optimizer

code like 

```
int x = this->x;

if (x == 1){
  do_smth();
  }

  if (x == -1){
    do_other();
  }
```

is compiled to

```
switch(this->x) {
  case 1:
    do_smth();
    break;
  case -1:
    do_other();
    break;
}
```



while 

```
int x = this->x;

if (this->x == 1){
  do_smth();
}

if (x == -1){
  do_other();
}

```

is compiled to

```
int x = this->x;

if (x == 1){
  do_smth();
}

if (x == -1){
  do_other();
}

```

worse code

- classes/structures with other inner structures/arrays will have weird indexing (i.e SEntry in CMenu)


using structures/classes can change code gen - check Utils_turnsTowards, it was using eax,cx on the += and -= statements with i16 but when replace with CSVector it fixed it.
